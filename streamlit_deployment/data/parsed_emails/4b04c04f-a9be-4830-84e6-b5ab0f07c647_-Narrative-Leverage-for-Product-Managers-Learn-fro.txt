How top PMs use storytelling as a product strategy—and how you can too
One of the biggest mistakes product managers make? Waiting until the end of the process to think about storytelling.

🔥 What This Session Is About
Titled “Narrative Leverage: How to Build Stories Like You Build Products,” this talk isn’t just about communications—it’s about crafting product narratives that drive alignment, unlock buy-in, and land with lasting impact.
Our speaker, Akash Miharia, is a Senior PM at Walmart and the founder of the Product Rookies newsletter. He’s helped lead AI, Personalization, and Search initiatives driving over $1.5B in business impact. He’s also one of the sharpest narrative thinkers in product today.
In this session, Akash will share how storytelling is not something you tack on at the end—it’s a repeatable skill you can learn, refine, and use to transform your work into movement.
🎯 What You’ll Learn
✅ Why storytelling isn’t fluff—it’s a strategic skill with structure and clarity
✅ The 3-part storytelling framework Akash uses to land offers, align teams, and drive launches
✅ The difference between “telling the work” and “framing the story”
✅ A live case study rewrite showing how to turn a flat project summary into a compelling narrative
✅ How to apply storytelling to job interviews, product reviews, and 0→1 pitches
💡 What You’ll Walk Away With
A storytelling structure you can apply across product, career, and comms
A clarity checklist to apply to any deck, PRD, or narrative artifact
A new lens on how to tell your own story with impact—inside and outside your org
👥 Who It’s For
PMs who want to lead more effectively
Job seekers trying to stand out
Founders and operators pitching new ideas
Anyone building work that deserves to resonate and scale
