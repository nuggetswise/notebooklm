Today, I’m excited to launch a new AI product community with Peter Yang, current Product Lead at Roblox, author of Creator Economy (100k+ subs), and instructor of “Become an AI Powered Product Leader” on Maven.
We kept hearing the same thing from our readers and students:
“I want to meet other people who are tinkering with AI.”
“Where can I find real AI workflows that actually work?”
“I want to see what AI apps people have built and how they did it.”
So Peter and I are starting this Slack community to help you use AI to save time, get more done, and build great products.
Here's what you get as a community member:
Our best AI resources for free including Colin’s Technical Foundations for PMs course [ https://substack.com/redirect/b78b2c39-cad3-49f4-be29-7f73f6a35ca5?j=eyJ1IjoiYXpucmUifQ.-8uBcpk8-HDATmkL0LtRV3v-RBLbqZCsv5EbXeOlA6M ] (4.7 stars, 84 lessons), Peter’s AI prompt library [ https://substack.com/redirect/6ec2ec09-d245-4eea-b348-4742b80b34a7?j=eyJ1IjoiYXpucmUifQ.-8uBcpk8-HDATmkL0LtRV3v-RBLbqZCsv5EbXeOlA6M ] (24+ go-to prompts), and a new prompt library for AI apps (see below).
Live workshops with AI experts, starting with an AMA with Peter and me this Friday at 3:30 pm pst.
Meet other product leaders and founders from Google, Meta, Netflix, and more who have taken our courses and are AI enthusiasts.
Upgrade to paid to get a link to join the community right away.
What's included: Full course and prompt libraries
Here's what we're making available to community members at launch:
1. Colin’s Tech Foundations for PMs course [ https://substack.com/redirect/b78b2c39-cad3-49f4-be29-7f73f6a35ca5?j=eyJ1IjoiYXpucmUifQ.-8uBcpk8-HDATmkL0LtRV3v-RBLbqZCsv5EbXeOlA6M ] (84 lessons)
Colin has taught this course to 900 PMs with a 4.7 rating and he’s generously making it available to community members for free. Above is a snapshot of what the course covers (modules include video and text walkthroughs).
2. Peter’s battle-tested AI prompt library
This library includes 24+ prompts that I use every week for product, creator, and personal tasks. Peter updates this library regularly — no fluff, just prompts that work.
3. New AI prototyping prompt library
This library includes one-shot prompts to build our favorite apps with AI. It’s still a work in progress but we’re looking forward to improve it with your help.
Look forward to seeing you in the community!
