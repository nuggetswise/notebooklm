üëã Hey,¬†it‚Äôs üì£ Coach Erika!¬†Welcome to a ‚ú® paid subscriber edition ‚ú® of The Career Whispers. I tackle reader questions about tech careers: how to get one, how to navigate them, and how to grow and thrive in your role.
Some personal news:
I took a new role in January, working on frontier AI in Google DeepMind. Some of my writing will likely shift toward AI tools and roles, which I suspect will be interesting to most of you. I am still getting clarity on what I can/will write about, but hopefully this post gives you a taste of what‚Äôs top of mind for me, which is: AI models, AI careers, and life+careers in a post-AGI world.
Hey, friend! If you by some miracle are not yet subscribed, here, let me help you with that.
‚Üì Let‚Äôs dive in to what‚Äôs top of mind: Superintelligence and Human Data (ScaleAI) 
Q: What is happening with Meta Superintelligence and ScaleAI? I heard there are $100M job offers flying around that people are crazy enough to actually turn down. What is superintelligence anyway? How do I get one of those offers?
Many of you in tech are reading about blockbuster ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù of $14B human data deals and Zuck collecting AI CEOs and $10M to $100M job offers that people are apparently insane enough to turn down. Lots of you have reached out to ask me what is this insanity, and below are Coach Erika‚Äôs loose thoughts:
Mark Z is feeling mega FOMO after the flop [ https://substack.com/redirect/fb4b5d55-fdd6-46cb-b3c0-6f9f94cfb7c1?j=eyJ1IjoiYXpucmUifQ.-8uBcpk8-HDATmkL0LtRV3v-RBLbqZCsv5EbXeOlA6M ] that was the Llama 4 model launch.
Nobody wants to work at Meta, but everyone loves üí∏ MONEY üí∏ ‚Äî and with their mega offers, AI researcher compensation now rivals Saudi Prince annual yacht allowances.
Mark Z is collecting AI CEOs to staff his superintelligence play ‚Äî lots of big egos, big paychecks, and big responsibilities ‚Äî this is going to be interesting üëÄüçø
Meta ‚Äúbought‚Äù ScaleAI without ‚Äúbuying‚Äù ScaleAI. At a time when pretty much everything about American corporate regulation is a free-for-all, so they will probably get by with this odd deal. But ScaleAI‚Äôs customer‚Äôs aren‚Äôt buying it, and contracts are being pulled (and placed elsewhere‚Ä¶blue sky opportunity for human data vendors).
SurgeAI [ https://substack.com/redirect/dc09796c-67df-4065-a388-c1ab12b0121e?j=eyJ1IjoiYXpucmUifQ.-8uBcpk8-HDATmkL0LtRV3v-RBLbqZCsv5EbXeOlA6M ], ScaleAI‚Äôs top competitor in the human data space, is probably about to fundraise. Let‚Äôs see who ‚Äúbuys‚Äù them without ‚Äúbuying‚Äù them‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs a fabulous time to be a chip maker, an AI researcher, and a human data supplier.
The full breakdown is for paid subscribers only, and it includes my predictions for what is likely to happen next in the ScaleAI/human data world, and what‚Äôs coming for AI compensation and careers:...
