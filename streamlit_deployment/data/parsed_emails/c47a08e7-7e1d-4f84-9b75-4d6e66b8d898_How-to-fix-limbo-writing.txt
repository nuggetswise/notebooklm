üëã Hey, it‚Äôs¬†Wes. Welcome to my newsletter on managing up, leading teams, and standing out as a high performer.
‚ú® Announcement: I‚Äôm updating my publishing cadence from weekly to bi-weekly. Going forward, you‚Äôll hear from me every other week.
For context, the weekly format was great for nearly two years, but keeping up with publishing something new every week is tough. Lately, I realized twice a month is more sustainable.
For now, I plan on keeping the newsletter free and appreciate you being here. If you‚Äôd like to support me, or if my work has impacted you and you‚Äôd like to go deeper, check out my course on executive communication and influence [ https://substack.com/redirect/477d3f27-b5cd-4446-b090-534102e38838?j=eyJ1IjoiYXpucmUifQ.-8uBcpk8-HDATmkL0LtRV3v-RBLbqZCsv5EbXeOlA6M ].
I originally published a version of this essay in August 2020. If you find it helpful, please share with friends. Enjoy.

Mediocre copy is a missed opportunity.
As an operator and leader, you need every lever you have to win. You could have an incredible idea‚Ä¶ But if you have poor messaging, all your hard work is wasted. Bad messaging obscures your value.
On the other hand, good messaging is an amplifier. It takes a seed of something good and aggrandizes it.
The benefit is a transference of emotion. Of course you feel excited about your idea. With good messaging, you can TRANSFER that feeling to your recipient.
To improve your messaging, you can do three things:
Improve your writing
Improve your idea
Improve both
It‚Äôs hard to quantify the value of clear thinking and clear writing
When writing is obviously bad, you delete it.
When writing is obviously good, you ship it.
But what if it‚Äôs not terrible, but it‚Äôs not good either?
Now we‚Äôre in a grey zone where there‚Äôs no easy fix.
I call this limbo writing.
It‚Äôs just kind of there. Neither dead nor alive.
Editing limbo writing takes a disproportionate amount of mental effort. Because the problem often isn‚Äôt the copy. The problem is that the underlying idea is fuzzy.
The lack of a point of view expresses itself as mediocre copy.
As a marketer, founder, or product owner, there simply aren‚Äôt enough levers to treat copy as a throwaway. We have to use every lever to the max.
Here‚Äôs how to fix limbo copy, depending on the underlying issue.
When the problem is the writing execution
There are lots of good resources on how to write well, so I‚Äôll keep this short.
Add rhythm by varying the sentence structure. Rhythm is hard to put your finger on. It‚Äôs what gives writing a good pace. It‚Äôs why people say, ‚ÄúThe book was long but it felt fast.‚Äù
Use a mix of short and long sentences for a dynamic feel. This is an easy and fun one. Read through your writing and mark sentences you want to make longer or shorter.
Trim excess fat to make your writing tighter. Say it in fewer words. If you feel bored reading it, remove it. If it‚Äôs too much backstory, remove it. Start right before you get eaten by the bear [ https://substack.com/redirect/9da144b4-f9b9-4070-9f78-e52211defbc1?j=eyJ1IjoiYXpucmUifQ.-8uBcpk8-HDATmkL0LtRV3v-RBLbqZCsv5EbXeOlA6M ].
Strengthen your claim stronger by adding data points, surprising statistics, numbers. You won‚Äôt have to shout because these help make your point. Your reader comes to your conclusion themselves.
Swap out weak nouns and verbs. Get rid of adverbs while you‚Äôre at it. You can usually remove descriptors if your readers won‚Äôt need that detail.
Sound like a human, not what you think a business professional sounds like. No one talks like the corporate machines from your college career center manuals.
Avoid double negatives. Double negatives are confusing. Don‚Äôt make your reader think too hard.
When the problem is the underlying idea
Clarify what you want to say in the first place. Writing is the vessel to express your idea. If you don‚Äôt know what you want to say, no amount of good writing can compensate for the lack of an idea.
Finish the knock-knock joke. Does the idea feel incomplete? Sometimes, we write the first half of a knock-knock joke, but we forget the payoff. If that‚Äôs the case, add the ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù to complete your thought.
Even a tweet has a narrative arc. Even in 280 characters, there‚Äôs a beginning, middle, and end. That‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt pull a few random sentences from a blog post and turn it into a tweet. It will feel incomplete because there‚Äôs no tension. Make sure whatever you‚Äôre writing is a standalone unit, whether it‚Äôs a work email or a 280 character tweet.
‚ÄúI am not a crook‚Äù makes people think you are a crook. Plant ideas you want people to think of. My favorite example of what NOT to do is Richard Nixon saying, ‚ÄúI am not a crook.‚Äù Then everyone thought, ‚ÄúHmm I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it before‚Ä¶ But you are TOTALLY a crook.‚Äù More on why to avoid incepting negative ideas [ https://substack.com/redirect/8eb061c2-20fe-4a61-abec-98dac1db5d74?j=eyJ1IjoiYXpucmUifQ.-8uBcpk8-HDATmkL0LtRV3v-RBLbqZCsv5EbXeOlA6M ].
Explicitly state your assumptions and rationale. It‚Äôs like showing your work in math class. Share the thought process behind your recommendation. This helps your manager give feedback on specific logical gaps instead of tossing out your whole idea. It creates the basis for a productive conversation.
Scarce + relevant = valuable. Teach something people don‚Äôt already know. What‚Äôs both surprising and true? Instead of summarizing and recapping, how can you make your contribution additive? There‚Äôs too much of the same-same already.
Clarify your stance. Have a spiky point of view [ https://substack.com/redirect/00c78990-9f8c-45da-8fbd-ca7677fe1c55?j=eyJ1IjoiYXpucmUifQ.-8uBcpk8-HDATmkL0LtRV3v-RBLbqZCsv5EbXeOlA6M ] rooted in evidence that others can disagree with.
Articulate the action you want your reader to take. Once you have your call-to-action, give them reasons to give you an enthusiastic yes [ https://substack.com/redirect/4f78b84e-5b97-4ba1-a8b3-2c3521c12209?j=eyJ1IjoiYXpucmUifQ.-8uBcpk8-HDATmkL0LtRV3v-RBLbqZCsv5EbXeOlA6M ].
Remember: Messaging is one of the few levers available for getting your customers to take action. 
Besides the product design, the messaging is how you set expectations and offer surprise and delight. 
It‚Äôs how you build closeness with your customer. It‚Äôs how you frame your product‚Äôs value. 
Don‚Äôt waste this lever.
